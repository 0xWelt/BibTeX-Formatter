# BibTeX Formatter
Help generate citations that meet the requirements for conference and journal submissions.

## Get Started
Clone the repo to anywhere you want and cd into the directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nickydusk/bibtex_formatter.git
cd bibtex_formatter.git
```

Copy your original BibTeX file to that directory and name it `in.bib`. Then run the following command and you will get a formatted BibTeX file `out.bib` and a log indicating what happened.

```bash
python format.py
```
